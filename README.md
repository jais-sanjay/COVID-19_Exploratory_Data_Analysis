# COVID-19_Exploratory_Data_Analysis
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. Most people infected with COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardio - vascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.

During the entire course of the pandemic, one of the main problems that healthcare providers have faced is the shortage of medical resources and the proper plannning to efficiently distribute them. In these tough times, being able to predict what kind of resource an individual might require at the time of being tested positive or even before that will be of immense help to the authorities as they would be able to procure and arrange for the resources necessary to save the life of that patient.
